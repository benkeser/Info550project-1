## Inequality and COVID-19 in Virginia

My project is using county-level COVID-19 data from the Virginia Department of Health dataset 'VDH-COVID-19-PublicUseDataset-Cases.csv' and income inequality data from the 2000 Census dataset 'county5.csv'. The datasets will be analyzed using R.


## Bash Code to conduct the analysis

You will need to run the analysis from the project folder, and you can use the following bash code to execute it:

```bash
make covid_report
```
The output will be a file called 'covid_inequality.html' in the Rmd folder within the repository.
